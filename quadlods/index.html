<p>Quadlods is a program for generating low-discrepancy sequences, originally Richtmyer sequences and now also Halton sequences. Both kinds of sequences use prime numbers for the dimensions. Since there are 6542 primes less than 65536, that is the maximum number of dimensions.</p>

<figcaption>This is a scatter plot of two primes, 65027 and 65029, which make particularly bad plots in both Richtmyer and Halton when unscrambled. This sequence is Tipwitch-scrambled.</figcaption>
